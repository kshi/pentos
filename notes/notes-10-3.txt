Adam: detect unoccupied space inaccessible by roads and avoid moves which create such space

Yishwan: treat parks/ponds as buildings and try to pack them tightly
(versus making parks/ponds stick out to maximize surface area)

g9: gaps of 8 cells seems to work best for a nice random distribution

horizontal roads with vertical parks/ponds might work better for symmetric shapes rather than horizontal everything

Tian: detect from history what the distribution is
