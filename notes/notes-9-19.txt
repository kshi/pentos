g1
factories at bottommost location, residences at topmost location, building parks/ponds using random walks.
top/bottommost row is chosen, ties broken horizonally by choosing leftmost

g2
appears very similar to g1. 

the default shortest path road building algorithm produces roads with lots of sharp turns around other structures.
Jingyu suggests that cells are wasted when a road turns because the perimeter of turning roads is less than of straight roads

g3
same code but without ponds/parks

Adam: the default random ponds/parks produced approximately +100 point advantage over no ponds/parks, averaged over 10 runs
Michael: buildings are worth less than 1 point per cell because they require road cells which do not give points
Jullian: can measure points per cell value of buildings/ponds/parks while the player is running and make decisions based on online measurements rather than predetermined thresholds
Michael: road to a new building should not touch existing buildings that are already connected

g4
preallocates roads leaving vertical space of 5 cells between, with one of 2 cells

g5
diagonal separation of residences/factories, no parks or ponds

Adam suggests that residences placed on the border should be placed with parks/ponds, and to anticipate with each building whether it will be on the border

g6
allocates space for factories of each side length
fills in space with water/park to create convex shapes regardless of whether a pond/park is created or not

Lou suggests parks/ponds can be extended by fewer than 4 cells to reach adjacent residences rather than creating new parks/ponds


g8
similar top/bottom separation. using only parks or only ponds appeared to be better than using both, at least using the default random park/pond generator and placing both down at the same time

Avidan: if only using parks, replacing a single park with a pond would never decrease the score but can possibly increase the score
Lou: should alternate between building parks and ponds

g9
similar top/bottom separation

the professor suggests that size-5 empty spaces should be top priority placement location for any residence which comes in with that shape


g10 
only uses adjacent cells to currently built buildings as candidate locations for future buildings of the same type so that buildings are packed closely together
seems to place unecessarily many roads



Deliverable for next Monday:
try to improve upon default road/park/pond generators
